## üîç Project Overview

**EcoVisit** serves as a comprehensive AQI solution with the following features:
- **Monitor:** Real-time AQI data for major tourist destinations in India, presented on an interactive map.
- **Compare:** Historical AQI comparison for the past 12 months, offering insights into the air quality trends.
- **Predict:** AI-powered AQI predictions for the upcoming year to help users plan visits based on future air quality.

---

## üéØ Problem Statement

In recent years, air pollution has become a growing concern for tourists looking to explore different parts of India. Eco-conscious travelers are seeking reliable information about air quality before making decisions on where and when to travel. **EcoVisit** addresses this problem by providing real-time and predictive AQI insights, helping users plan trips to destinations with optimal air quality.

---

## üåü Key Features

1. **Interactive Map:** Displays real-time AQI data for major tourist locations across India. States are color-coded based on AQI levels for easy interpretation (green = good, red = hazardous).
   
2. **AQI Predictions:** Uses AI models to predict AQI for the upcoming year. Users can select a month and destination to receive AQI forecasts and recommendations for the best time to visit.

3. **Comparison Table:** Allows users to compare AQI trends from the last 12 months, highlighting destinations with significant changes.

4. **News and Highlights:** Alerts and news updates related to significant AQI changes or environmental events affecting air quality.
